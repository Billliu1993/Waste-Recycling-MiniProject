# Waste-Recycling-MiniProject

This project is a personal practice for building up an image recognition app for IOS system using MS Azure and Swift. 
* Motivation
Effective waste recycling requires careful categorization of wastes. However, given the large number of waste categories, this process could be time-consuming. Herein, there is demand for automated image recognition protocols to accelerate the process.

* Techniques
1. The computer vision model was constructed and trained using custom vision on MS Azure.
2. The model was imported to XCode and ensembled to an iso app using Swift (based upon Apple's sample code: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/classifying_images_with_vision_and_core_ml)

* Future direction
Future work will be focusing on the customization of the computer vision model based upon the benchmark model from MS Azure.
